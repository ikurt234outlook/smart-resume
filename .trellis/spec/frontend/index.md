# Frontend Development Guidelines

> Frontend conventions for the Smart Resume web application.

---

## Overview

This project uses TypeScript and Ant Design for a resume-building web interface.

The frontend should be organized around product features rather than a flat component dump. The initial focus is a maintainable editing workspace with clear typing and predictable state flow for create, edit, export, and share experiences.

## Confirmed Stack

* UI library: Ant Design
* Language: TypeScript
* Package manager: pnpm 10.34.5 via Corepack
* Product type: browser-based resume workspace
* Primary concerns: form-heavy editing, preview rendering, export/share interactions

## Expected Frontend Areas

The first implementation pass should leave room for:

* password setup and password entry pages
* resume editor pages
* shared form controls for sections like personal info, education, work experience, project experience, skills, personal summary, honors/awards, and certificates
* template selection and template-specific preview rendering
* preview/export related views
* share-related views and actions
* API client and request typing shared across features

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English** and updated when implementation patterns stabilize.
