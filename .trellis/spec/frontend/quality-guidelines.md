## Forbidden Patterns

### Don't: Duplicate Stable Magic Values In UI Code

**Problem**:

```tsx
// Don't do this
<ResponsiveModal width={720} />
autoSize={{ minRows: 3, maxRows: 8 }}
return target.scrollHeight - target.scrollTop - target.clientHeight <= 64
params.set('pageSize', String(query.pageSize ?? 6))
```

**Why it's bad**: Stable UI thresholds, validation bounds, pagination defaults, and sizing rules drift quickly when copied across components and helpers. This makes behavior inconsistent and increases the chance that frontend and backend contracts diverge silently.

**Instead**:

```tsx
// Do this instead
<ResponsiveModal width={INTERVIEW_MODAL_WIDTH} />
autoSize={{ minRows: INTERVIEW_COMPOSER_MIN_ROWS, maxRows: INTERVIEW_COMPOSER_MAX_ROWS }}
return target.scrollHeight - target.scrollTop - target.clientHeight <= INTERVIEW_SCROLL_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD
params.set('pageSize', String(query.pageSize ?? DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE))
```

**Rule**:

* If a value has business meaning, validation meaning, interaction meaning, layout-system meaning, or cross-layer contract meaning, do not repeat it as an inline literal across files.
* One-off presentational values that are used once and have no reusable meaning may stay inline.
* Repeated values must be named and owned by the nearest stable scope.

## Required Patterns

### Convention: All User-Facing Text Must Be Internationalized

**What**: Every string visible to the user (labels, placeholders, messages, errors, tooltips) must go through `react-i18next`'s `t()` function. Hard-coded Chinese or English literals in JSX are forbidden.

**Why**: The project supports `zh-CN` and `en-US`. A single hard-coded string breaks the experience for one locale and is easy to miss in review.

**How to apply**:

1. Import the hook with the correct namespace:

   ```tsx
   import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'
   const { t } = useTranslation('workspace') // pick the feature namespace
   ```

2. Add keys to **both** locale files simultaneously:
   - `frontend/src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/<namespace>.json`
   - `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en-US/<namespace>.json`

3. Namespace selection:

   | Feature area | Namespace |
   |---|---|
   | Login / password | `auth` |
   | Resume editor & preview | `workspace` |
   | Template picker & styling | `template` |
   | AI chat & scoring | `ai` |
   | Interview practice | `interview` |
   | Share links | `share` |
   | App-level (nav, settings, errors) | `common` / `system` |

4. Key naming: use dot-separated paths matching the UI hierarchy, e.g. `editor.exportPdf`, `feedback.exportPdfFailed`.

5. For non-component code (e.g. utility functions), import the i18n instance directly:

   ```ts
   import i18n from '../../../i18n'
   i18n.t('export.noPreviewError', { ns: 'template' })
   ```

**Validation**: Run `grep -rn ">[^<{]*[一-鿿]" frontend/src --include="*.tsx"` to detect hard-coded Chinese in JSX. Any match is a violation.

**Wrong vs Correct**:

```tsx
// Wrong: hard-coded string
<Button>导出 PDF</Button>

// Correct: internationalized
<Button>{t('editor.exportPdf')}</Button>
```

### Convention: Repeated Business And Interaction Thresholds Must Be Centralized Nearby

**What**: Repeated numeric thresholds with stable business or interaction meaning must be extracted into nearby constants instead of being copied across components, hooks, and API helpers.

**Why**: Shared defaults such as pagination sizes, password-length limits, modal widths, and scroll/composer thresholds change over time. Centralizing them reduces drift between pages, features, and backend contracts.

**How to apply**:

1. Put cross-feature HTTP defaults in shared modules under `frontend/src/lib/`.
2. Put feature-specific thresholds in that feature's `constants.ts`.
3. Prefer names that describe intent, such as `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`, or `INTERVIEW_SCROLL_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD`.
4. Do not extract one-off presentational values with no reuse or domain meaning.

**Ownership rule**:

* Cross-feature request defaults belong in shared modules such as `frontend/src/lib/http/pageDefaults.ts`.
* Feature-specific interaction/layout thresholds belong in that feature's `constants.ts`.
* Validation limits mirrored from backend contracts should use the same named constant family on the frontend instead of repeating raw numbers in form rules.

**Examples**:

```ts
// Wrong: duplicated defaults
params.set('page', String(query.page ?? 1))
params.set('pageSize', String(query.pageSize ?? 6))

// Correct: centralized defaults
params.set('page', String(query.page ?? DEFAULT_PAGE))
params.set('pageSize', String(query.pageSize ?? DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE))
```

**Good/Base/Bad cases**:

* Good: put interview modal width, scroll thresholds, report score cutoffs, and composer row counts into `features/interview/constants.ts`.
* Base: extract shared pagination defaults used by multiple features into `lib/http/pageDefaults.ts`.
* Bad: keep `6`, `64`, `720`, `80`, or `3/8` repeated across API files, components, and form rules after the second usage appears.

### Convention: All New Features Must Adapt to Mobile (≤ 480px)

**What**: Every user-facing feature must be usable on a 375px-wide viewport. This includes layout, interaction, and navigation — not just "doesn't overflow."

**Why**: A significant portion of users access the app on phones. Features that only work on desktop create a broken experience and generate bug reports.

**How to apply**:

1. **Detect mobile** via the shared hook:

   ```tsx
   import { useIsMobile } from '../../lib/hooks/useIsMobile'
   const isMobile = useIsMobile()
   ```

   Breakpoint: `max-width: 480px` (defined in `useIsMobile.ts`).

2. **Modals → bottom Drawer on mobile**: Use `ResponsiveModal` (`frontend/src/components/shared/ResponsiveModal.tsx`) instead of raw `Modal`. It renders a bottom `Drawer` on mobile automatically.

   ```tsx
   <ResponsiveModal open={open} title="..." onCancel={close} onOk={submit}>
     {content}
   </ResponsiveModal>
   ```

3. **Layout patterns**:
   - Multi-column grids → single column on mobile (use `@media (max-width: 480px)` in `index.css`)
   - Desktop action bars → collapsed into `Dropdown` or mobile-specific action row
   - Sticky headers/footers → respect `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for notched devices

4. **Touch targets**: Buttons and interactive elements must be at least 40px tall on mobile (enforced by the global rule `.ant-btn:not(.ant-btn-sm):not(.ant-btn-link):not(.ant-btn-text) { min-height: 40px }`).

5. **Conditional rendering pattern** (desktop vs mobile variants):

   ```tsx
   <div className="actions--desktop">{/* full toolbar */}</div>
   <div className="actions--mobile">{/* collapsed dropdown */}</div>
   ```

   Then in CSS:
   ```css
   .actions--mobile { display: none !important; }
   @media (max-width: 480px) {
     .actions--desktop { display: none !important; }
     .actions--mobile { display: flex !important; }
   }
   ```

6. **Off-screen rasterization sources** (PDF export, share cards): Must be insulated from mobile media queries. See [Component Guidelines → Styling Patterns](./component-guidelines.md#styling-patterns).

**Validation checklist** (before marking a feature complete):

- [ ] Open the page on a 375px viewport (Chrome DevTools → iPhone SE)
- [ ] All content is reachable without horizontal scroll
- [ ] All buttons/links are tappable (≥ 40px touch target)
- [ ] Modals appear as bottom drawers
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming (≥ 14px body text)
- [ ] No layout overflow or overlapping elements

**Common Mistakes**:

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Using raw `Modal` instead of `ResponsiveModal` | Modal is clipped or unreachable on mobile | Replace with `ResponsiveModal` |
| Adding a new `@media (max-width: …)` rule without checking export source | PDF export layout breaks on mobile | Add matching override in `.resume-export-source` scope |
| Forgetting `display: none` toggle for desktop/mobile action variants | Both variants render simultaneously | Add the CSS toggle pair |
| Using `vw` units in template styles | Export source renders at wrong size on mobile | Use fixed `px` values or override in export scope |

## Testing Requirements

<!-- What level of testing is expected -->

(To be filled by the team)

## Scenario: pnpm-managed frontend builds

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies when changing dependencies, frontend build commands, or the frontend container image.
- Covers `frontend/` only. `browser-extension/` remains an independent npm package.

### 2. Signatures

- Package manager: `pnpm@10.34.5`, declared by `packageManager` in `frontend/package.json`.
- Reproducible install: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- Quality commands: `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`.
- Container build: `docker compose build frontend`.

### 3. Contracts

- `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` is the only frontend lockfile; do not add `frontend/package-lock.json`.
- Every package imported by frontend source must be declared directly in `frontend/package.json`.
- Docker builds must enable Corepack and install from the frozen pnpm lockfile.
- `frontend/.dockerignore` must exclude `node_modules` and `dist` so host artifacts cannot overwrite Linux dependencies.
- Root build scripts prefer `corepack pnpm` and may fall back to a global pnpm installation.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `package.json` and lockfile differ -> frozen install fails; regenerate and commit the lockfile.
- Source imports an undeclared transitive package -> type-check may fail with `TS2307`; add it as a direct dependency.
- Host `node_modules` enters the Docker context -> executable or platform-specific dependency failures; keep it ignored.
- Corepack and global pnpm are both unavailable -> root scripts exit with an actionable dependency error.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: update `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then pass frozen install, lint, build, and the frontend image build.
- Base: run `pnpm install` intentionally while changing dependencies, then verify with a frozen install.
- Bad: run npm in `frontend/`, commit a second lockfile, or copy host `node_modules` into an image.

### 6. Tests Required

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` completes without lockfile changes.
- `pnpm lint` exits successfully.
- `pnpm build` completes TypeScript and Vite production builds.
- `docker compose build frontend` produces the Nginx image from the same frozen lockfile.
- `bash -n build.sh start.sh` passes after package-manager command changes.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```dockerfile
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
```

#### Correct

```dockerfile
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build
```

## Scenario: BOSS Browser Extension Extraction

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: the standalone `browser-extension/` package extracts visible BOSS Zhipin job data and sends user-confirmed values to Smart Resume.
- This needs code-spec depth because it depends on a third-party SPA DOM, Chrome MV3 messaging, and application payload fields.

### 2. Signatures
- Content request: `{ type: 'GET_JOB_SNAPSHOT' }`
- Content response: `{ company: string; position: string; jobDescription: string; extraNotes: string; url: string; warnings: string[] }`
- Popup fallback: if `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` fails, inject `content-script.js` with `chrome.scripting.executeScript`, then retry the same request.
- Application create payload from extension: `channel: 'Boss直聘'`, `status: 'applied'`, selected `resumeId`, and notes containing the captured source URL plus JD summary and extra metadata.
- Popup view state: after a cover letter is generated, keep it in popup state and expose a `job` / `letter` tab switch so users can return to the generated letter without regenerating it.

### 3. Contracts
- Extraction reads only the current visible page DOM in the user's active tab.
- Prefer specific BOSS selectors such as `.job-name`, `.boss-name`, `.company-name`, and `.job-detail-body .desc`.
- On BOSS SPA pages, do not treat `window.location.href` as the only source identity. Prefer the current job card's `a.job-name[href]` or `a[href*="/job_detail/"]` because switching jobs may update the detail pane without changing the address bar.
- Do not use broad selectors such as `[class*="company"] [class*="name"]` when a narrower BOSS-specific selector exists, because they can match entire mixed company/location/card sections.
- Normalize extracted position text by removing salary ranges before it enters popup state.
- Put salary, education requirement, and work-duration/experience tags into `extraNotes`; do not store them in `position`.
- The popup should not render an editable source URL field for BOSS jobs. Keep the captured URL internal for notes and duplicate prevention.
- The extension must keep extracted fields editable before any Smart Resume write or AI request.
- The popup must have only one primary page scrollbar. Keep `html`/`body` overflow hidden and let `.extension-shell` own vertical scrolling; avoid stacking the browser popup scrollbar on top of the app scrollbar.
- Generated cover letters should render in a separate view instead of being appended below the job form, so long letters do not bury the current job controls.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Content script is not loaded -> popup injects `content-script.js` and retries once.
- Company missing after extraction -> return `company_missing` in `warnings`.
- Position missing after extraction -> return `position_missing` in `warnings`.
- JD missing after extraction -> return `job_description_missing` in `warnings`.
- BOSS security/verification page is visible instead of job DOM -> extraction may return warnings; the popup remains a manual-edit form.
- Captured card URL is missing -> duplicate mapping falls back to `company + position + resumeId`.
- Cover letter exists and user switches back to job form -> keep the existing `coverLetter` in state and allow switching back to it.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: a list/detail page returns company from `.boss-name` or `.company-name`, position from `.job-name`, and JD from `.job-detail-body .desc`.
- Base: selectors fail but the document title provides a partial company or position, with warnings for fields still missing.
- Bad: position includes salary text such as `15-25K`, causing application records to store salary inside the job title.
- Bad: a broad company selector returns company plus location, financing, industry, or job-card text.
- Bad: switching jobs in the same BOSS SPA pane keeps using `window.location.href`, causing stale URL and duplicate mapping drift.
- Bad: appending the generated cover letter below the job form, producing a long nested-scroll popup where users cannot easily return to the result.

### 6. Tests Required
- `browser-extension` type-check must pass after changing content script, popup messaging, or Chrome API typings.
- `browser-extension` build must pass so `dist/manifest.json`, `dist/content-script.js`, `dist/popup.js`, and `dist/service-worker.js` stay loadable.
- Manual assertion on a logged-in BOSS job page: switching jobs and clicking refresh updates company, position, JD, and extra notes from the active detail pane even if the address bar does not change.
- Manual assertion in the popup: after generating a cover letter, the `职位信息` / `求职信` switch toggles views and the outer browser scrollbar is not visible.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct
#### Wrong
```typescript
const company = firstText(['[class*="company"] [class*="name"]'])
const position = firstText(['[class*="job"] h1'])
```

#### Correct
```typescript
const company = firstText(['.job-detail-company .company-name', '.company-name', '.boss-name'])
const position = cleanPosition(firstText(['.job-name', 'a.job-name', '.job-title']))
```

## Code Review Checklist

* Repeated user-facing thresholds or defaults are not left as copied inline literals.
* Shared pagination, validation, or API defaults use named constants with clear ownership.
* Feature-specific layout and interaction values are centralized in the feature constants module when reused.
* Frontend values that mirror backend contracts do not silently drift from backend defaults.
